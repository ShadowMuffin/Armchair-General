# Armchair-General
A tactical grand-strategy game, ruled by you - an armchair general!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE THAT ANYTHING THAT IS WRITTEN HERE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, SINCE THE GAME IS AT AN EXTREMELY EARLY STAGE

Background:
The game is set in a WW2 (WW1/Cold war might be added in the future) battlefield the size of around 100 SqKm. You are a general commanding an entire army, and your goal is to subdue the enemy by either inflicting losses, or pushing them out of the battlefield completely before any reinforcements arrive. 

For Anyone That Wants To Help:
You are free to propose changes and test the game whenever you want! The game will be programmed mainly in C++, and ran as a simple 2D map with icons representing the battlefield units. Since I (ShadowMuffin) am not very experienced with videogame programming, my methods and workflow might not be ideal; if you notice anything you want changed, you can raise an issue or just fix it yourself! All help is welcome, as long as you stay organized and let others know what you are planning on doing.
